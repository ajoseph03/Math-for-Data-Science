## **Florida's Tree Planting Initiatives in Light of Climate Change: Key Takeaways**

### **Climate Change & Carbon Sequestration**

- Climate change might cause Florida's iconic palm trees to be replaced over time due to their lower carbon sequestration abilities.
- Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels today are higher than in the last 800,000 years, highlighting the urgency to either reduce emissions or remove existing CO2.
- Trees play a vital role in absorbing and storing carbon through the process of photosynthesis. However, not all trees are equally efficient.

### **Palm Trees vs. Canopy Trees**

- Palm trees are less effective in carbon sequestration compared to canopy trees. A palm in southern Florida absorbs about 5 pounds of CO2 yearly, while trees like oaks, mahogany, pines, and cedars can sequester over 3,000 pounds of CO2 in their lifetime.
- Kristine Crous points out that palms donâ€™t produce wood, making them less effective at storing carbon.
- It's highlighted that a passenger vehicle emits roughly 10,000 pounds of CO2 annually, emphasizing the need for efficient tree planting.
  
### **Efforts in Florida**

- Miami Beach and West Palm Beach are taking steps to plant trees that can effectively combat climate change. Miami Beach's "Rising Above" plan proposes that by 2050, palms should constitute no more than 25% of the public tree population.
- Species like the Southern Live oak are resistant to challenges like floods, hurricanes, and salt spray, making them suitable for Florida's environment.

### **The Importance of Mature Trees**

- Younger trees absorb less carbon dioxide than their older counterparts.
- Mature trees are crucial in fighting climate change; they're particularly vulnerable to stronger hurricanes exacerbated by global warming.
- Research shows mature oak trees can ramp up photosynthesis by up to a third in higher CO2 environments. A global study aims to understand how trees, especially mature ones, react to rising atmospheric CO2 levels.

### **Tree Planting in Florida: Action Steps**

- West Palm Beach distributes 1,000 native trees annually for residents and businesses.
- While palms are iconic to Florida, there is a pivot towards planting more efficient trees such as oaks, ash, elm, and sycamore.
- Tree selection isn't just about climate benefits but also about other factors like maintenance, costs, and avoiding issues like fertilizer runoff.
- There's a mechanism in place where developers, if they remove trees and can't replace them, contribute to a fund that ensures trees are planted elsewhere.

### **Final Thought**

Planting trees is a critical aspect of addressing climate change. However, the focus should not just be on the quantity but also on the quality, age, and type of trees being planted and preserved. It's essential to strike a balance between planting new trees and valuing existing old-growth forests.

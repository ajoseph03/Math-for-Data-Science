    print(np.array(image_list[i]).shape)

This line of code serves the purpose of printing the shape (dimensions) of an image stored in a Python list, specifically the `i`-th image within the `image_list`. It uses the NumPy library to convert the image data into a NumPy array and then accesses the `shape` attribute of that array to provide information about the image's size.

## Line Breakdown

- `image_list[i]`: This part of the code retrieves the `i`-th element from the `image_list`, assuming that `image_list` is a Python list containing image data.

- `np.array(...)`: The `np.array()` function from the NumPy library is used to convert the image data into a NumPy array. NumPy arrays are commonly used for numerical computations and offer useful attributes like `shape`.

- `.shape`: The `.shape` attribute is accessed to retrieve the dimensions of the NumPy array. In the context of image data, the shape typically represents the dimensions in the order of (height, width, number of color channels). For example, a shape of `(300, 400, 3)` indicates that the image is 300 pixels tall, 400 pixels wide, and has 3 color channels (commonly representing Red, Green, and Blue, for a color image).

- `print(...)`: This part of the code prints the result to the console, making it visible to the user or developer.

## Use Case

Understanding the shape of an image is essential when working with image data in various applications. It helps you determine the image's size and structure, which can be crucial for tasks like image processing, resizing, or when you need to ensure compatibility with other parts of your code.

## Example

Here's an example of how this line of code might be used:

```python
import numpy as np

# Assume image_list contains image data
image_list = [image1, image2, image3, ...]

# Determine the number of images in the list
n = len(image_list)

# Loop through the images and print their shapes
for i in range(n):
    print(np.array(image_list[i]).shape)
```

In this example, it iterates through the `image_list`, converts each image to a NumPy array, and prints the shape of each image to the console.

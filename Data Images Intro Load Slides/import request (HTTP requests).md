# `import requests`

## Overview

The line of code `import requests` is a common Python statement used to import the `requests` library into your Python script or program. This library is widely used for making HTTP requests to web services and websites, and it simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests and handling the responses.

## Purpose

When you include `import requests` in your Python script, you gain access to the functionality provided by the `requests` library. This allows you to interact with web services and retrieve data from websites, make API calls, and perform various HTTP operations, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

## How to Use

To utilize the `requests` library in your Python script, follow these steps:

1. **Import the Library**: Begin your script by including the line `import requests`. This tells Python to make the `requests` library available for use in your code.

    ```python
    import requests
    ```

2. **Use `requests` Functions**: After importing the library, you can use its functions and methods to make HTTP requests. Common functions include `requests.get()`, `requests.post()`, `requests.put()`, `requests.delete()`, and more.

    Example:

    ```python
    # Sending a GET request
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')

    # Checking the response status code
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Success, handle the response content
        data = response.json()
        print(data)
    else:
        # Handle errors
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
    ```

3. **Handle Responses**: Depending on the type of request you make, you'll receive a response object that contains information about the HTTP response, including headers, status code, and content. You can then parse and process the response data as needed.

## Installation

If you don't already have the `requests` library installed, you can do so using pip, Python's package manager. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
pip install requests
```

This will download and install the `requests` library from the Python Package Index (PyPI) so that you can use it in your Python projects.

## Documentation

For more detailed information on how to use the `requests` library and its features, you can refer to the official documentation:

- [Requests Documentation](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)

## Compatibility

The `import requests` statement is compatible with Python 2 and Python 3, but it is recommended to use Python 3 for new projects, as Python 2 is no longer supported.

## License

The `requests` library is open-source and is distributed under the Apache 2.0 License. You can find more information about the license in the library's documentation.

### `get_google_slide(url)`

```python
def get_google_slide(url):
    url_head = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/"
    url_body = url.split('/')[5]
    page_id = url.split('.')[-1]
    return url_head + url_body + "/export/pdf?id=" + url_body + "&pageid=" + page_id
```

This function takes a Google Slides presentation URL as input and returns a modified URL that can be used to download the presentation as a PDF. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the function does:

1. `url_head = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/"`: This line sets the base URL for Google Slides presentations.

2. `url_body = url.split('/')[5]`: It extracts the unique identifier of the Google Slides presentation from the input URL. This identifier is essential for constructing the download URL.

3. `page_id = url.split('.')[-1]`: This line extracts the page ID from the URL, which is the last part of the URL after the period ('.'). The page ID is used to specify a specific page in the presentation when downloading.

4. Finally, the function constructs and returns a new URL by combining the `url_head`, `url_body`, and `page_id` to create a URL that can be used to export the Google Slides presentation as a PDF.

### `get_slides(url)`

```python
def get_slides(url):
    url = get_google_slide(url)
    r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)
    open('file.pdf', 'wb').write(r.content)
    images = convert_from_path('file.pdf', 500)
    return images
```

This function uses the `get_google_slide(url)` function to fetch the PDF export URL for the provided Google Slide URL. It then downloads the PDF, extracts the slides as images, and returns a list of images.

This function takes a Google Slides presentation URL as input and uses the `get_google_slide(url)` function to get the PDF download URL. It then downloads the PDF, converts it into a series of images, and returns those images as a list. Here's how it works:

1. `url = get_google_slide(url)`: This line calls the `get_google_slide(url)` function to obtain the PDF download URL for the Google Slides presentation.

2. `r = requests.get(url, allow_redirects=True)`: It uses the `requests` library to send an HTTP GET request to the PDF download URL, allowing redirects.

3. `open('file.pdf', 'wb').write(r.content)`: This line saves the content of the response (the PDF file) to a local file named "file.pdf" in binary write mode ('wb').

4. `images = convert_from_path('file.pdf', 500)`: It uses a PDF conversion library (likely PyPDF2 or pdf2image) to convert the downloaded PDF file into a series of images. The '500' parameter specifies the resolution in DPI (dots per inch) for the images.

5. Finally, the function returns a list of images representing the pages of the Google Slides presentation.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use these functions:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define a Google Slides presentation URL
slides_url = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/your-presentation-id/edit"

# Convert the presentation to images
images = get_slides(slides_url)

# Display the first image
plt.imshow(images[0])
plt.show()
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- The `requests` library for making HTTP requests.
- A PDF conversion library such as `PyPDF2` or `pdf2image` for converting the downloaded PDF into images.

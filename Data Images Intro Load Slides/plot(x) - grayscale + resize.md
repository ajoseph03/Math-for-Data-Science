# Function: `plot(x)`

## Description
The `plot` function is a Python function used to visualize a 2D array `x` as a grayscale image using the matplotlib library. This function is particularly useful for displaying data in a matrix-like format as an image.

## Usage
To use this function, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries at the beginning of your Python script:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

2. Call the `plot(x)` function and pass the 2D array `x` as its argument. For example:

```python
# Example usage
plot(my_array)
```

3. The function will display the grayscale image of the input array `x`.

## Function Details

### `fig, ax = plt.subplots()`
- This line creates a new figure (`fig`) and a set of subplots (axes) within that figure (`ax`).
- You can customize the plot by modifying the `ax` object.

### `im = ax.imshow(x, cmap='gray')`
- This line creates an image on the axes (`ax`) using the 2D array `x`.
- The `cmap='gray'` parameter specifies that the colormap 'gray' should be used, resulting in a grayscale image.

### `ax.axis('off')`
- This line turns off the axis labels and ticks for the plot. In image visualization, axis labels are usually unnecessary.

### `fig.set_size_inches(5, 5)`
- This line sets the size of the figure (`fig`) to be 5 inches by 5 inches. You can adjust the size to control how large or small the displayed image will be.

### `plt.show()`
- Finally, this line is used to display the figure with the image on your screen. It is essential for rendering and showing the plot.

## Example
Here's a simple example of how to use the `plot` function:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define a 2D array
my_array = [[0, 1, 0],
            [1, 0, 1],
            [0, 1, 0]]

# Call the plot function to visualize the array as an image
plot(my_array)
```

This will display a 3x3 grayscale image based on the input array.

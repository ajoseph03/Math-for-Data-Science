# Introduction

```python
```python
def plot(x):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    im = ax.imshow(x, cmap='gray')
    ax.axis('off')
    fig.set_size_inches(5, 5)
    plt.show()
```
1. `fig, ax = plt.subplots()`: This line creates a new figure and a set of subplots (axes) within that figure. `fig` is the figure object, and `ax` is the axes object. You'll use `ax` to customize and display your plot.

2. `im = ax.imshow(x, cmap='gray')`: This line creates an image (imshow stands for "image show") on the specified axes `ax` using the 2D array `x`. It also specifies the colormap to use for the image, which in this case is 'gray', indicating a grayscale image.

3. `ax.axis('off')`: This line turns off the axis labels and ticks for the plot. This is often done when displaying images because you typically don't need the axis labels for simple visualizations of images.

4. `fig.set_size_inches(5, 5)`: This line sets the size of the figure (`fig`) to be 5 inches by 5 inches. You can adjust the size to control how large or small the displayed image will be.

5. `plt.show()`: This line displays the figure with the image on it. It's necessary to use `plt.show()` to actually render and show the plot on your screen.

So, when you call `plot(x)` with a 2D array `x`, it will create a grayscale image representation of that array, turn off the axis labels and ticks, set the figure size to 5x5 inches, and then display the image. This is a common way to visualize 2D data as images using matplotlib in Python.



## Function: `plot(x)`

## Description
The `plot` function is a Python function used to visualize a 2D array `x` as a grayscale image using the matplotlib library. This function is particularly useful for displaying data in a matrix-like format as an image.

## Usage
To use this function, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries at the beginning of your Python script:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

2. Call the `plot(x)` function and pass the 2D array `x` as its argument. For example:

```python
# Example usage
plot(my_array)
```

3. The function will display the grayscale image of the input array `x`.

## Function Details

### `fig, ax = plt.subplots()`
- This line creates a new figure (`fig`) and a set of subplots (axes) within that figure (`ax`).
- You can customize the plot by modifying the `ax` object.

### `im = ax.imshow(x, cmap='gray')`
- This line creates an image on the axes (`ax`) using the 2D array `x`.
- The `cmap='gray'` parameter specifies that the colormap 'gray' should be used, resulting in a grayscale image.

### `ax.axis('off')`
- This line turns off the axis labels and ticks for the plot. In image visualization, axis labels are usually unnecessary.

### `fig.set_size_inches(5, 5)`
- This line sets the size of the figure (`fig`) to be 5 inches by 5 inches. You can adjust the size to control how large or small the displayed image will be.

### `plt.show()`
- Finally, this line is used to display the figure with the image on your screen. It is essential for rendering and showing the plot.

## Example
Here's a simple example of how to use the `plot` function:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define a 2D array
my_array = [[0, 1, 0],
            [1, 0, 1],
            [0, 1, 0]]

# Call the plot function to visualize the array as an image
plot(my_array)
```

This will display a 3x3 grayscale image based on the input array.

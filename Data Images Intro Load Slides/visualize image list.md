# Readme: Visualizing and Inspecting Images in a Loop

This README explains a code snippet that demonstrates how to visualize and inspect a list of images in a loop using Python. The provided code allows you to iterate through a list of images (`image_list`) and perform two actions for each image:

1. Display the image using a function called `plot`.
2. Print the dimensions (shape) of the image as a NumPy array.

## Code Explanation

Here's a breakdown of the code:

```python
for i in range(n):
    plot(image_list[i])
    print(np.array(image_list[i]).shape)
```

- `for i in range(n)`: This line initiates a `for` loop that iterates through a range of values from 0 to `n-1`. The loop variable `i` represents the current index of the image in the `image_list`.

- `plot(image_list[i])`: Inside the loop, this line calls a function named `plot` to display the image located at the `i`-th index of the `image_list`. The `plot` function is assumed to be defined elsewhere in your code and is responsible for rendering the image, typically using a library like Matplotlib.

- `print(np.array(image_list[i]).shape)`: After displaying the image, this line prints the dimensions (shape) of the `i`-th image. It uses NumPy's `np.array` and `shape` attributes to obtain the shape of the image. The shape typically includes the width, height, and the number of color channels (e.g., for a color image, it might print something like `(height, width, 3)` for three color channels).

By executing these lines of code within the loop, you can visualize and inspect each image in the `image_list` one by one, observing both the image itself and its dimensional properties.

## Usage

To use this code snippet, you should have a list (or any iterable) named `image_list` containing image data. You can adjust the `n` value in the `for` loop to control how many images from the list you want to visualize and inspect.

Here's an example of how to use this code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define a list of images (replace with your actual images)
image_list = [image1, image2, image3, ...]

# Determine the number of images in the list
n = len(image_list)

# Loop through the images and visualize/inspect each one
for i in range(n):
    plot(image_list[i])
    print(np.array(image_list[i]).shape)
```

Replace `image1`, `image2`, etc., with your actual image data, and the code will display and print information about each image.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Libraries for image visualization (e.g., Matplotlib) and image manipulation (e.g., NumPy) as required by the `plot` function.

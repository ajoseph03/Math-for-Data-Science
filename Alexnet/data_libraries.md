# Python Libraries Overview

This document provides an overview of various Python libraries and tools used in data science, machine learning, and image processing.

## Libraries and Tools

1. **wandb (`wandb`)**: A tool for tracking and visualizing machine learning experiments, useful for monitoring models, comparing experiments, and sharing results.

2. **poppler-utils**: A utility for rendering PDFs, commonly used for converting PDF files into different formats.

3. **pdf2image (`pdf2image`)**: Converts PDF files into images, typically relying on `poppler-utils` as a backend.

4. **requests**: A library for making HTTP requests, used in web scraping, API interactions, and general web communication.

5. **matplotlib.pyplot (`plt`)**: Part of Matplotlib, this library is used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

6. **numpy (`np`)**: Essential for scientific computing, it offers array operations and serves as a backend for other scientific libraries.

7. **torch**: PyTorch, a machine learning library providing tools for deep learning with a flexible and dynamic computational graph.

8. **torchvision**: A part of PyTorch, it includes datasets, model architectures, and image transformation tools for computer vision.

9. **torchvision.transforms**: A submodule of `torchvision` for common image transformations, aiding in preprocessing for deep learning models.

10. **torchvision.models**: Provides pre-trained models on datasets like ImageNet for applications in image classification, object detection, etc.

11. **wandb as wb**: An alias for the `wandb` library, allowing for shorthand usage in code.

These libraries collectively support tasks in data handling, image processing, and machine learning, especially in computer vision.

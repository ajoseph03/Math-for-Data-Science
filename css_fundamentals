# CSS Fundamentals

## Introduction

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation and layout of web documents. It is a fundamental technology for web development, allowing you to control the visual appearance of HTML elements. This README will introduce you to the key concepts and syntax of CSS.

## Including CSS

CSS can be included in an HTML document in several ways:

### 1. Inline CSS

You can include CSS directly within an HTML element using the `style` attribute.

```html
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">This is a blue text with a font size of 16 pixels.</p>
```

### 2. Internal CSS

You can include CSS within the HTML document using the `<style>` element in the document's `<head>` section.

```html
<head>
    <style>
        p {
            color: blue;
            font-size: 16px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <p>This is a blue text with a font size of 16 pixels.</p>
</body>
```

### 3. External CSS

You can link an external CSS file to your HTML document using the `<link>` element in the `<head>` section.

```html
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

## Selectors

Selectors are used to target HTML elements for styling. CSS provides various types of selectors:

- **Element Selector**: Targets all elements of a specific type.
  ```css
  p {
      color: blue;
  }
  ```

- **Class Selector**: Targets elements with a specific class attribute.
  ```css
  .highlight {
      background-color: yellow;
  }
  ```

- **ID Selector**: Targets a single element with a specific ID attribute.
  ```css
  #header {
      font-size: 24px;
  }
  ```

- **Combination Selector**: Targets elements that meet multiple conditions.
  ```css
  p.highlight {
      font-weight: bold;
  }
  ```

## Properties and Values

CSS properties define the styling attributes, while values specify the settings for those properties. Here are some common CSS properties:

- `color`: Sets the text color.
- `background-color`: Sets the background color.
- `font-family`: Specifies the font family.
- `font-size`: Sets the font size.
- `margin`: Defines the margin around an element.
- `padding`: Defines the padding inside an element.
- `border`: Sets the border properties (color, width, style).
- `text-align`: Aligns text within an element.
- `display`: Defines how an element should be displayed.

## Comments

You can add comments to your CSS code using `/* ... */`.

```css
/* This is a CSS comment */
p {
    color: red;
}
```

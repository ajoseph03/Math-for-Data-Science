# HTML Basics and Syntax

## Introduction

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It defines the structure and content of a web page. In this README, we'll cover the fundamental HTML concepts and syntax.

## HTML Structure

An HTML document consists of the following basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Document Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Defines the document type and version (HTML5).
- `<html>`: The root element that contains all other HTML elements.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata about the document, such as the character set and the title.
- `<meta charset="UTF-8">`: Specifies the character encoding for the document (UTF-8 is common).
- `<title>`: Sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's title bar.
- `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the web page.

## HTML Elements and Tags

HTML uses elements and tags to define content and structure. Elements are enclosed by opening and closing tags. Here are some common HTML elements:

- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`: Headings (from largest `<h1>` to smallest `<h6>`).
- `<p>`: Paragraphs of text.
- `<a href="URL">`: Hyperlinks (links to other web pages).
- `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">`: Images with a source and alternative text.
- `<ul>` and `<ol>`: Unordered and ordered lists.
- `<li>`: List items within `<ul>` or `<ol>`.
- `<div>`: A generic container for grouping elements.
- `<span>`: A generic inline container for styling or scripting.
- `<br>`: Line break (self-closing tag).
- `<hr>`: Horizontal line (self-closing tag).

## HTML Attributes

HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information or settings. Attributes are always specified in the opening tag. For example:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
```

In the above examples, `href` and `src` are attributes that define the destination URL and image source, respectively.

## Creating Your First HTML Page

To create your first HTML page:

1. Create a new text file and save it with the `.html` extension (e.g., `index.html`).
2. Open the file with a text editor.
3. Add the basic HTML structure mentioned earlier.
4. Insert your content within the `<body>` element.
5. Save the file.
6. Open it in a web browser to view your HTML page.

## Conclusion

This README provides a brief overview of HTML basics and syntax. HTML is the foundation of web development, and learning it is essential for creating web pages. To explore more advanced HTML topics and web development, consider referring to additional resources and tutorials.
